# Model Registry with MLFlow

This example shows the [MLFlow Metrics Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) and  [MLFlow Model Registry](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#) workflows

The repository is based on the [mlflow_monitoring](https://gith ub.com/evidentlyai/evidently/tree/main/examples/integrations/mlflow_monitoring) integration example from [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/)
